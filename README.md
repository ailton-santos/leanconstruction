# Lean Construction

The program aims to simulate the schedule of a construction project, taking into account:

Value-adding activities (e.g. planning, construction execution, inspection) and
Non-value-adding activities (such as permitting and mobilization), which may be delayed due to inefficiencies.
In addition, the program makes it possible to apply a Lean improvement factor (from 0 to 1) that reduces delays in non-value-added activities. This simulation can be carried out in two ways:

Detailed Simulation: Displays the complete schedule with start, finish and duration of each activity.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Runs several simulations to estimate statistics (average duration, efficiency, minimum and maximum), allowing you to analyze the variability of the results.
